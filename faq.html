                <p class="has-text-centered">Available on all devices, Gift provides suggestions for
                    nearby not-for-profits and charities in need of items users no longer need. Users simply upload
                    their unwanted or items to be donated and Gifta provides real time solutions â€“ making disposal
                    sustainable and ethical whilst reusing items to those in need.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="has-text-centered">By showing users where to take their donations on a map of
                    their immediate area, Gifta encourages members of the local community to cultivate sustainable
                    re-purposing habits. Users are able to input a postcode or select search results generated based on
                    their location.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="has-text-centered">Users have the ability to comment on the app to share their
                    tips and tricks as well as share content from the app to promote their giving, repurposing and
                    reusing. Importantly, the app will also inform users which items should not be donated and which
                    items are in demand around their area. </p>
